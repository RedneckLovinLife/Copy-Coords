# Copy-Coords
Simple script for getting coords. Specifically for vector 2, 3, 4, Lixiero's truck_logistics parking locations, and cd_garage coords, 

USAGE

/cc2  = vector3(1512.109, 3757.7354)

/cc3  = vector3(1512.109, 3757.7354, 33.9995)

/cc4  = vector4(1512.109, 3757.7354, 33.9995, 204.0667)

/cct = ['truck_parking_location'] = {-368.45,-133,38.71,76.34},

/ccg  =  x_1 = 1512.3927, y_1 = 3757.3716, z_1 = 33.9997, (Used for cd_garage)

/ccg2 = x_2 = 1512.3927, y_2 = 3757.3716, z_2 = 33.9997, h_2 = 109.3732, (Used for cd_garage)
